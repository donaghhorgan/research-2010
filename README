=== Usage ===

The repository is organised as follows:

  * The .nb files are Mathematica notebooks and provide the means to generate 
    and/or alter the results shown in the published version of the paper.
  * The .m files are Mathematica packages, providing function definitions 
    used in the notebooks - you do not need to edit these directly (in fact, 
    you don't have to look at them at all if you don't want to - Mathematica 
    will load them at runtime).
